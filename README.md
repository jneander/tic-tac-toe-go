# Tic Tac Toe

Written in Go

## Setup

1. Install [Go](http://code.google.com/p/go/downloads/list)
2. ``git clone git@github.com:jneander/tic-tac-toe-go.git``
3. ``cd tic-tac-toe-go``
4. ``./setup``

## Running the Tests

1. ``cd ttt``
2. ``go test``

To see a more verbose output from the tests, use the ``-v`` flag as follows:

``go test -v``

*Go test output can be difficult to follow. I recommend only using the verbose flag if you're curious.*

## Running the Game

While in the 'tic-tac-toe-go' directory, run the following command:

``./tic-tac-toe-go``

*This executable was built on OS X. If you are on a different platform, you may need to create another build using Go.*

## Additional Resources

In order to use most of Go's features, you'll need to do some extra setup. The Go command-line tools have some requirements for workspace paths and environment variables. For more information, read the [Go Documentation](http://golang.org/doc/code.html).
