#Tic Tac Toe
Written in Go

###Setup

1. Install [Go](http://code.google.com/p/go/downloads/list)
2. ``git clone git@github.com:jneander/tic-tac-toe-go.git``
3. ``cd tic-tac-toe-go``
4. ``./setup``

###Running the Tests

``go test``

To see a more verbose output from the tests, use the ``-v`` flag as follows:
``go test -v``

*note: Go test output can be difficult to follow. I recommend only using the verbose flag if you're curious.*

###Running the Game

``./tictactoe``
